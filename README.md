## Make Change Project

### Description
This is a program to calculate change for a purchase.

To start the program, run it. Next, enter the amount the item is that is to be purchased. Then, enter an amount of money that you have to pay for that item. The program should calculate down to exact change and label the denominations of the change that would be returned to the customer. If you do not supply enough money for the item, an error message will be displayed. If you give exact change, the program will let you know and that is the end of the process.
